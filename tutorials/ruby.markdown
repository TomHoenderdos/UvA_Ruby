####Let’s install some Ruby!

[Windows][1]  

OS X:  
brew install ruby  

Linux:  
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1  

####Hello World

Create a text file called hello-world.rb containing the following code:  

<pre>puts ‘Hello world’</pre>  

Now run it:  

ruby hello-world.rb  

You can also run the short “hello world” program without creating 
a text file. This is called a one-liner:  

Ruby -e "puts 'Hello world'"  

You can run this code with irb, but the output will look slightly different. puts will print out "Hello world”, but irb will also print out the return 
value of puts – which is <pre>nil</pre>.  

irb  
>> puts “Hello world”  
Hello world  
=> nil  

####Syntax

Let’s say you have a class Person: 

<pre>class Person  
end</pre>  

person = Person.new  
person.name # => no method error  

Obviously we never defined method name. Let’s do that: 

class Person
  def name
    @name # simply returning an instance variable @name
  end
end

person = Person.new
person.name # => nil
person.name = "Dennis" # => no method error

We can read the name, but that doesn’t mean we can assign the name. Those are two different methods. Former called reader and latter called writer. We didn’t create the writer yet so let’s do that. 

class Person
  def name
    @name
  end

  def name=(str)
    @name = str
  end
end

person = Person.new
person.name = 'Dennis'
person.name # => "Dennis"

Awesome. Now we can write and read instance variable @name using 
reader and writer methods. But why waste time writing these methods 
every time? 

class Person  
  attr_reader :name  
  attr_writer :name
end

Even this can get repetitive. When you want both reader and writer, 
just use accessor: 

class Person
  attr_accessor :name
end

person = Person.new
person.name = “Dennis”
person.name # => “Dennis”

class Person
  attr_accessor :name

  def greeting
    “Hello #{@name}”
  end
end

person = Person.new
person.name = “Dennis”
person.greeting # => “Hello Dennis”


Starting a new Ruby project:
cd ..
mkdir Ruby_uva
bundle gem Ruby_uva
cd Ruby_uva
git commit -m “Empty project”
rspec --init

####BDD

Let’s create that Gemfile: 

source “http://rubygems.org”

gem “rack”
gem “cucumber”
gem “rspec”

Run bundle
